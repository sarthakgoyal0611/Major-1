One of the causes that intruders can be successful is that most of the information they acquire from a system is in a form that they can read and comprehend. Intruders may disclose the information to others, modify it to misrepresent an individual or organization, or use it to dispatch an attack. One key solution to this problem is, through the use of steganography.
Steganography is the procedure of hiding of a secret message within an ordinary message or image and extracting it to its required genuine destination. Steganography is the art of invisible communication by concealing information inside different information.
A steganography system consists of 3 elements: cover-object (which hides the key message), the key message and therefore the stego-object (which is that the cowl object with message embedded within it.) A digital image is represented employing a 2-D matrix of the color intestines at every grid purpose (i.e. pixel). Typically, grey pictures use eight bits. The most important objective of Steganography is especially involved with the protection of contents of the hidden info. 
Pictures are ideal for information concealment, as a result of the big quantity of redundant area is formed within the storing of pictures. 
In this method, the secret messages are transmitted through unknown cowl carriers in a way that the disastrous existences of the embedded messages are not detectable. Carriers hold images; audio, video, text or the other digitally diagrammatical code or transmission. The hidden message could also be plaintext, cipher text or something diagrammatical.
Even though related, Steganography should never be compared with encryption, which is the process of encoding data or information in such a way that it can only be read by certain people —Steganography attempts to hide the existence or presence of data or information.

Problem Statement-
This project resolves the security problem of transmitting the data over internet network, the main intention when we start asking that how we can send a message secretly to the destination. The science of steganography answers this question successfully. Using steganography, information can be hidden in carriers such as images, audio files, text files, videos and data transmissions. In this project, we have inferred methods using algorithms of an image steganography system to hide a digital text/image of a secret message.

Objective-
•	Steganography model is required to carry and hide sensible information.
•	Important objective of our project is to conceal data in one to one communication.
•	Analysis of different colour maps and Grayscale analysis of image is one of the objectives to be achieved.
